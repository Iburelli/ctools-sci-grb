# ctools-sci-grb

This repository hosts the refactoring of the ctools pipeline for CTA-GRB-WG: https://github.com/thomasgas/ctools_pipe.

## Environment **

To create a virtual environment with all required dependencies:

```bash
conda env create --name <envname> --file=environment.yaml
```

Note that you should already have anaconda installed: https://www.anaconda.com/

### Calibration Database

To complete the environment be sure to download and install the correct IRFs (only prod2 comes with ctools installation). Public ones can be found here: https://www.cta-observatory.org/science/cta-performance/
